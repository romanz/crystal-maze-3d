Building the library
--------------------

To compile and install Xbgi, make sure you installed the development
packages for X11; on Ubuntu, it's libx11-dev and its depencencies.
Then:

  $ cd src
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

which installs libXbgi.a in /usr/lib and graphics.h in /usr/include.

Type 'make demo' to make a demo program. More test programs are
available in directory test/ and can be compiled after you have built
libXbgi.a:

  $ cd src/test
  $ make

Most programs written for BGI graphics in Turbo C/Borland C++ should
compile unmodified. See Using.txt.

.rpm and .deb packages are available at
http://libxbgi.sourceforge.net/
