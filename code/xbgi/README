This is Xbgi, part of PtoC:
http://www.garret.ru/ptoc/Readme.htm

PtoC implements BGI (Borland Graphics Interface) emulation for MS
Windows and X11. The former is called WinBGI, and is available at
http://www.garret.ru/winbgi.zip. Xbgi is an X11 implementation that
works on Linux and other Unix systems.

PtoC is yet another Pascal to C/C++ converter. The primary idea of
this converter is to produce readable and supportable code which
preserves style of original code as far as possible.

PtoC and associated software were written by Dr. Konstantin Knizhnik,

Packaging, RGB support, mouse support, fill and line patterns, minor
fixes and test programs by Dr. Guido Gonzato, guido.gonzato at
gmail.com. Packages (.rpm and .deb) and documentation are available at
http://libxbgi.sourceforge.net/
