Test programs for Xbgi
----------------------
By Guido Gonzato, PhD


1. 'bgidemo' is Borland's demo program for Turbo C 2.01. Minor
modifications were needed to port this program to Xbgi; mostly,
conio.h functions.

2. 'fern' is a famous IFS system; see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system

3. 'hopalong' is an implementation of Barry Martin's algorithm,
presented in the September 1986 issue of Scientific American. Run it
as ./hopalong <seed>, where <seed> is an integer number.

4. 'mandelbrot.c' is a simple, non-optimised program to display the
Mandelbrot set. It shows how to setup and use RGB colour mode. Press
'1', '2', '3' to change palette; left click to zoom in on a point;
right click to zoom out; middle click to restore the initial boundary.

5. 'mousetest.c' shows how to detect and use mouse clicks. Click
around using all buttons and mouse wheel.

6. 'moveit' shows how to detect movement keys.

7. 'simple' displays simple shapes to test Xbgi's speed.

8. 'turtledemo' uses a simple yet powerful turtle graphics
implementation to draw fractals and simple shapes.

9. 'userpalette' shows how to implement a user-defined RGB palette,
should you need more than MAXRGBCOLORS colors.


Notes on Turtle Graphics
------------------------

Turtle graphics is based on polar coordinates: you draw lines
specifying a distance in pixels and an angle in degrees, called
"heading" (0-359). Heading is the same as the bearing of a compass: it
starts from 0 ("North") and increases clockwise.

For a thorough explanation, please read:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_Graphics

Commands available are:

void back (int);              move the turtle backwards by <int> pixels
void forwd (int);             move the turtle forwards by <int> pixels
int  heading (void);          get the turtle heading (0-359)
void hideturtle (void);       hide the turtle
void home (void);             move the turtle to the screen centre
                              and set the heading to 0
void pendown (void);          activate drawing (put the pen down)
void penup (void);            suspend drawing (lift the pen)
void setheading (int);        set the turtle heading to <int> (0-359)
void setposition (int, int);  move the turtle to <x>, <y>
void showturtle (void);       show the turtle
void turnleft (int);          turn the turtle left by <int> degrees
void turnright (int);         turn the turns right by <int> degrees
void wrap (void);             wrap around the window
void nowrap (void);           don't wrap around the window
int  xcor (void);             get the turtle's X coordinate
int  ycor (void);             get the turtle's Y coordinate

By default, the turtle is not visible, the pen is down, and the
heading is 0.

Constants:

T_TRUE       1
T_FALSE      0
T_NORTH      0
T_EAST      90
T_SOUTH    180
T_WEST     270

Please read turtle.h for more details.
